# Python - Almost a circle

I built a program in Python that uses special building blocks called "classes" to represent rectangles and squares. These classes are like mini-programs that 
store information about the shapes and can do things like calculate their area. To make sure my program works correctly, I wrote tests for each class using a tool called 
"unittest". It's like checking your work with a special ruler to make sure everything is the right size and shape.

The three classes involved utilizing the following Python tools:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Private attributes
* Getter/setter
* Class/static methods
* Inheritance
* File I/O
* `args`/`kwargs`
* JSON and CSV serialization/deserialization
* Unittesting

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder containing the following independently-developed test files:
  * [test_parent.py](./tests/test_parent.py)
  * [test_rectangle.py](./tests/test_rectangle.py)
  * [test_square.py](./tests/test_square.py)

## Classes :cl:

### Parent
Represents the "Parent" class for all other classes in the project. Includes:

* Private class attribute `__nb_objects = 0`.
* Public instance attribute `id`.
* Class constructor `def __init__(self, id=None):`
  * If `id` is `None`, increments `__nb_objects` and assigns its value to the public instance attribute `id`.
  * Otherwise, sets the public instance attribute `id` to the provided `id`.
* Static method `def to_json_string(list_dictionaries):` that returns the JSON string serialization of a list of dictionaries.
  * If `list_dictionaries` is `None` or empty, returns the string `"[]"`.
* Class method `def save_to_file(cls, list_objs):` that writes the JSON serialization of a list of objects to a file.
  * The parameter `list_objs` is expected to be a list of `Base`-inherited instances.
  * If `list_objs` is `None`, the function saves an empty list.
  * The file is saved with the name `<cls name>.json` (ie. `Rectangle.json`)
  * Overwrites the file if it already exists.
* Static method `def from_json_string(json_string):` that returns a list of objects deserialized from a JSON string.
  * The parameter `json_string` is expected to be a string representing a list of dictionaries.
  * If `json_string` is `None` or empty, the function returns an empty list.
* Class method `def create(cls, **dictionary):` that instantiates an object with provided attributes.
  * Instantiates an object with the attributes given in `**dictionary`.
* Class method `def load_from_file(cls):` that returns a list of objects instantiated from a JSON file.
  * Reads from the JSON file `<cls name>.json` (ie. `Rectangle.json`)
  * If the file does not exist, the function returns an empty list.
* Class method `def save_to_file_csv(cls, list_objs):` that writes the CSV serialization of a list of objects to a file.
  * The parameter `list_objs` is expected to be a list of `Base`-inherited instances.
  * If `list_objs` is `None`, the function saves an empty list.
  * The file is saved with the name `<cls name>.csv` (ie. `Rectangle.csv`)
  * Serializes objects in the format `<id>,<width>,<height>,<x>,<y>` for `Rectangle` objects and `<id>,<size>,<x>,<y>` for `Square` objects.
* Class method `def load_from_file_csv(cls):` that returns a list of objects instantiated from a CSV file.
  * Reads from the CSV file `<cls name>.csv` (ie. `Rectangle.csv`)
  * If the file does not exist, the function returns an empty list.
* Static method `def draw(list_rectangles, list_squares):` that draws `Rectangle` and `Square` instances in a GUI window using the `turtle` module.
  * The parameter `list_rectangles` is expected to be a list of `Rectangle` objects to print.
  * The parameter `list_squares` is expected to be a list of `Square` objects to print.
